Hello Everyone!
I am creating a Git Repository that has a protected Master Branch.
This repository is meant to create the SCM Project on Data Structures and I have chosen Linked List as the topic.

I am creating a class on CPP and I expect you guys to work as specified and create changes.
Note that I have created a class in C++ and you have to work accordingly.
Also comment the changes accordingly.

1) Prajjawal: 
Create subbranch Insert 
Make insertions from end and beginning
Commit and push from the insert branch

2) Nirmaljeet:
Create subbranch Delete
Make deletions from End and beginning
Commit and push changes from delete branch

3) Parth:

5) Sailesh:
